# Snowflake for Data Science: Intro to Snowpark ML for Python

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Snowflake for Data Science: Intro to Snowpark ML for Python" repository! This project showcases how to leverage Snowpark ML for Python to build an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and deployment.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the following steps:

1. **Loading Data**: Importing data into Snowflake and setting up the Python workspace.
2. **Data Transformation**: Utilizing the Snowpark ML API to transform data and build a preprocessing pipeline.
3. **Model Training**: Training an XGBoost model using the Snowpark ML Model API.
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploying the model as a User-Defined Function (UDF) for inference.[In progess]

### Scenario

In this project, you take on the role of a data scientist for a renowned diamond retailer. The objective is to build a predictive model to recommend optimal diamond purchase prices based on attributes such as Carat, Weight, and Cut Quality.
